WEBVTT

01:09.280 --> 01:11.920
I hit the sack

01:12.000 --> 01:14.360
I'm glad to be back

01:14.440 --> 01:17.480
from the noose

01:17.520 --> 01:19.280
hanging around

01:19.360 --> 01:22.640
and it's gettin' me high

01:22.720 --> 01:24.040
'cause I never die

01:24.120 --> 01:25.720
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.840
This is crazy.
What did I do?

01:27.880 --> 01:29.360
I feel like you're
going to pull over
and snuff me.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.880
What, you're not
allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

01:31.920 --> 01:33.160
We can talk, sir.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.680
Oh, I see.
So it's personal?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.040
No, you intimidate them.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.600
Good God, you're a woman.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.320
I honestly...
I couldn't have called that.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.840
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what
we're going for here?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.320
I thought of you
as a soldier first.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.720
I'm an airman.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.560
You have,
actually, excellent
bone structure, there.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.400
I'm kind of having
a hard time not
looking at you now.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.240
Is that weird?
Come on, it's okay, laugh.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.080
Sir, I have
a question to ask.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.200
Yes, please.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.960
Is it true you went
12 for 12 with last year's
Maxim cover models?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.200
That is an
excellent question.
Yes and no.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.760
March and I had
a scheduling conflict,

02:03.800 --> 02:06.760
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover
was twins.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.720
Anything else?
You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

02:09.760 --> 02:11.560
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.480
Yes. It's very cool.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.600
All right.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.760
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.440
Please, no gang signs.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.080
No, throw it up.
I'm kidding.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.920
Yeah, peace.
I love peace.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.280
I'd be out of
a job with peace.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.200
Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. Don't change
any settings. Just click it.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.000
What's going on?
WOMAN: Contact left!

02:39.080 --> 02:40.800
What have we got?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.120
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

02:44.160 --> 02:45.720
Stay down!
Yeah.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.120
Son of a bitch!

02:54.760 --> 02:56.120
Wait, wait, wait!
Give me a gun!

02:56.160 --> 02:57.560
Stay here!

03:26.840 --> 03:28.160
Whoa!

04:17.680 --> 04:18.920
NARRATOR: Tony Stark.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.880
Visionary. Genius.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.400
American patriot.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.840
Even from an early age,

04:26.880 --> 04:29.400
the son of legendary
weapons developer
Howard Stark

04:29.440 --> 04:33.040
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant
and unique mind.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.560
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.760
At age six, his first engine.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.280
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.640
Then, the passing of a titan.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.160
Howard Stark's
lifelong friend and ally,
Obadiah Stane,

04:51.240 --> 04:54.680
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

04:54.880 --> 04:58.200
until, at age 21,
the prodigal son returns

04:58.240 --> 05:01.680
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.080
With the keys to the kingdom,

05:03.160 --> 05:05.960
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

05:06.040 --> 05:10.080
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.080
Today, Tony Stark
has changed the face
of the weapons industry

05:14.120 --> 05:16.960
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

05:17.040 --> 05:19.600
and her interests
around the globe.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.280
As liaison to
Stark Industries,

05:30.880 --> 05:34.640
I've had the
unique privilege of
serving with a real patriot.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.480
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

05:41.200 --> 05:45.520
to present this
year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.080
Tony?

06:06.320 --> 06:08.960
Thank you, Colonel.
Thanks for the save.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.720
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.240
This is wonderful.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.120
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.120
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you
how honored I feel

06:25.480 --> 06:30.160
and what a joy it is
to receive this
very prestigious award.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.040
Tony, you know...

06:32.160 --> 06:36.080
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.520
He's always working.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.040
Work it! Come on!

06:46.600 --> 06:48.080
We should just
stay till the morning.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.160
You are unbelievable.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.880
Oh, no! Did they
rope you into this?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.520
Nobody roped me
into anything!

06:53.600 --> 06:54.560
I'm so sorry.
But they told me that

06:54.680 --> 06:57.520
if I presented
you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.560
Of course I'd be
deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.320
So when do we do it?
It's right here.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.560
Here you go.
There it is.
That was easy.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.000
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's okay.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.400
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.040
I don't have any of those
floating around.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.200
We're gonna let it ride!

07:12.360 --> 07:14.480
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little
something-something.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.680
Okay, you, too.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.640
I don't blow on a man's dice.
Come on, honey bear.

07:17.720 --> 07:20.240
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel
Rhodes rolls! And...

07:20.320 --> 07:21.560
DEALER: Two craps.
Line away.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.480
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.000
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

07:25.520 --> 07:26.560
This is where I exit.
All right.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
Tomorrow, don't be late.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.960
Yeah, you can count on it.
I'm serious!

07:29.040 --> 07:30.320
I know, I know.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.920
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's.
There you go.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.600
Mr. Stark!
Excuse me,
Mr. Stark!

07:40.920 --> 07:43.200
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.400
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.920
She's cute.
She's all right?

07:46.080 --> 07:47.080
Hi.
Hi.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.080
Yeah. Okay, go.
It's okay?

07:49.160 --> 07:51.000
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.920
What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.600
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.880
"The Merchant of Death"?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.480
That's not bad.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.320
Let me guess. Berkeley?

08:01.400 --> 08:02.560
Brown, actually.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.040
Well, Ms. Brown,

08:05.600 --> 08:07.560
it's an imperfect world, but
it's the only one we've got.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.360
I guarantee you,
the day weapons are no longer
needed to keep the peace,

08:10.440 --> 08:12.600
I'll start making
bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.800
Rehearse that much?

08:13.840 --> 08:15.520
Every night in
front of the mirror
before bedtime.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.640
I can see that.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.960
I'd like to show
you first-hand.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.280
All I want is
a serious answer.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.640
Okay, here's serious.
My old man
had a philosophy,

08:22.680 --> 08:25.120
"Peace means
having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

08:25.160 --> 08:27.480
That's a great line
coming from the guy
selling the sticks.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.880
My father helped
defeat the Nazis.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.360
He worked on
the Manhattan Project.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.000
A lot of people,
including your
professors at Brown,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.320
would call that
being a hero.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.560
And a lot of people
would also call that
war profiteering.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.800
Tell me,
do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

08:38.840 --> 08:40.640
by advancing
medical technology

08:40.680 --> 08:43.080
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

08:43.160 --> 08:46.400
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.920
You ever lose
an hour of sleep
your whole life?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.880
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.760
JARVIS ON SPEAKER:
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.520
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with
scattered clouds.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.000
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder
high lines.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.520
High tide will
be at 10:52 a.m.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.160
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA

09:34.520 --> 09:35.880
Tony?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.640
Hey, Tony?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.720
JARVIS: You are not authorized
to access this area.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.520
Jesus.
That's Jarvis.
He runs the house.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.640
I've got your clothes here.
They've been
dry-cleaned and pressed,

10:08.720 --> 10:10.480
and there's a car
waiting for you outside

10:10.560 --> 10:12.880
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.680
You must be
the famous
Pepper Potts.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.440
Indeed I am.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.200
After all these years,
Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.640
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

10:25.720 --> 10:28.520
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.680
Will that be all?

10:30.880 --> 10:31.920
Sometimes I try to do things

10:32.000 --> 10:34.320
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.600
and I get real frustrated

10:36.640 --> 10:38.640
and then, like,
I try hard to do it

10:38.720 --> 10:40.040
and I, like, take my time

10:40.080 --> 10:41.880
but it just doesn't work out
the way I want it to.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.080
It's like I concentrate
on it real hard

10:44.160 --> 10:46.560
but it just doesn't work out.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.240
Give me an exploded view.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.560
JARVIS: The compression
in cylinder three
appears to be low.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.200
Log that.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.960
I'm gonna try again,
right now.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
Please don't
turn down my music.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
I'll keep you posted.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.960
You are supposed to be
halfway around
the world right now.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.120
How'd she take it?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.400
Like a champ.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.040
Why are you
trying to hustle me
out of here?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.840
Your flight was
scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.040
That's funny,
I thought with it being
my plane and all,

11:10.120 --> 11:11.680
that it would
just wait for me
to get there.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.520
Tony,
I need to speak to you
about a couple things

11:13.600 --> 11:14.680
before I get you
out of the door.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.000
Doesn't it kind of defeat
the whole purpose
of having your own plane

11:17.080 --> 11:18.320
if it departs
before you arrive?

11:18.400 --> 11:21.760
Larry called. He's got
another buyer for the
Jackson Pollock in the wings.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.480
Do you want it?
Yes or no.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.640
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

11:26.440 --> 11:28.920
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood
in East Hampton

11:28.960 --> 11:30.280
where he lived and worked,

11:30.320 --> 11:31.840
not "spring" like the season.
So?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.040
I think it's a fair example.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.320
I think it's
incredibly overpriced.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.760
I need it.
Buy it. Store it.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.120
Okay. The MIT
commencement speech...

11:43.160 --> 11:46.000
Is in June. Please, don't
harangue me about stuff
that's way, way, down...

11:46.080 --> 11:48.480
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.080
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.520
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.520
What are you trying
to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.680
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.120
I don't like it
when you have plans.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.240
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.840
It's your birthday?
Yes.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.400
I knew that. Already?

12:01.480 --> 12:05.000
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day
as last year.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.240
Get yourself
something nice from me.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.520
I already did.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.600
And?

12:09.680 --> 12:11.160
Oh, it was very nice.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.520
Yeah.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.360
You're welcome,
Miss Potts.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.520
Okay.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.560
You're good. Oh, I thought
I lost you back there.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.080
You did, sir.
I had to cut
across Mulholland.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.760
I got you.
I got you.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.280
RHODES: What's wrong with you?

12:51.360 --> 12:52.880
What?
Three hours.

12:52.960 --> 12:55.120
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
For three hours.
For three hours
you got me standing here.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.760
Waiting on you now.
Let's go. Come on.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
Wheels up!
Rock and roll!

13:10.440 --> 13:13.080
What you reading, platypus?
Nothing.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.360
Come on, sour patch.
Don't be mad.

13:15.440 --> 13:18.160
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

13:18.240 --> 13:19.720
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Stark.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.920
You don't need to
apologize to me.
I'm your man.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.040
Hi. I told him
I was sorry, but he...

13:22.080 --> 13:23.520
I'm just
indifferent right now.
Hot towel?

13:23.600 --> 13:24.800
You don't respect yourself,

13:24.880 --> 13:26.280
so I know you
don't respect me.
I respect you.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.680
I'm just your babysitter.

13:27.760 --> 13:30.280
So, when you need
your diaper changed...
Thank you.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.520
Let me know and
I'll get you a bottle, okay?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.280
Hey! Heat up the sake,
will you?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.760
Thanks for reminding me.
No, I'm not talking...

13:35.800 --> 13:37.600
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.120
You can't have
sashimi without sake.
You are constitutionally

13:40.160 --> 13:41.760
incapable of
being responsible.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.280
It would be
irresponsible not to drink.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.400
I'm just talking
about a nightcap.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.520
Hot sake?

13:45.600 --> 13:46.640
Yes, two, please.
No.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.960
I'm not drinking.
I don't want any.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.360
That's what I'm
talking about.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.520
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.320
you know what I recognize?

13:55.400 --> 14:00.680
I see in that mirror that
every person that's got this
uniform on got my back!

14:00.760 --> 14:03.480
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you.
I'm not cut out...

14:03.520 --> 14:05.040
No, no. You don't
have to be like me!

14:05.120 --> 14:06.640
But you're more
than what you are.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.560
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.680
No! You can't be
distracted right now!
Listen to me!

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
General.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.040
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to
your weapons presentation.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.160
Thanks.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.920
Is it better to be
feared or respected?

14:39.040 --> 14:42.160
I say, is it too
much to ask for both?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.000
With that in mind,
I humbly present
the crown jewel

14:46.080 --> 14:47.880
of Stark Industries'
Freedom Line.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.000
It's the first
missile system

14:49.080 --> 14:51.960
to incorporate
our proprietary
repulsor technology.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.080
I respectfully disagree.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.200
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.640
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.520
And it's worked out
pretty well so far.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.000
Find an excuse

15:10.040 --> 15:13.360
to let one of these
off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

15:13.440 --> 15:17.000
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

15:35.480 --> 15:39.240
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

15:50.880 --> 15:51.880
I'll be throwing
one of these in

15:51.920 --> 15:53.960
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.080
To peace!

15:56.800 --> 15:58.880
Tony.
Obie, what are you doing up?

15:58.920 --> 16:01.440
I couldn't sleep till
I found out how it went.
How'd it go?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.320
It went great.
Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.280
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.840
Why aren't you wearing
those pajamas I got you?

16:08.920 --> 16:10.520
Good night, Tony.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.400
Hey, Tony.
I'm sorry,
this is the "fun-vee."

16:14.440 --> 16:16.440
The "hum-drum-vee"
is back there.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.840
Nice job.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.240
See you back at base.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.320
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.720
What the hell
did you do to me?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.080
What I did?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.160
What I did is to
save your life.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.040
I removed all
the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

18:16.120 --> 18:17.920
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.440
Here, want to see?

18:21.120 --> 18:23.920
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.840
I've seen many
wounds like that
in my village.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.360
We call them
the walking dead

18:31.400 --> 18:34.600
because it takes about
a week for the barbs to
reach the vital organs.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.480
What is this?
That is an electromagnet,

18:38.240 --> 18:40.400
hooked up to
a car battery,

18:40.440 --> 18:43.400
and it's keeping
the shrapnel from
entering your heart. Hmm?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.760
That's right. Smile.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.600
We met once, you know,
at a technical
conference in Bern.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.640
I don't remember.
No, you wouldn't.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.120
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have
been able to stand,

19:06.160 --> 19:09.360
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.760
Where are we?

19:12.680 --> 19:14.600
Come on,
stand up. Stand up!

19:15.560 --> 19:17.600
Just do as I do.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.360
Come on,
put your hands up.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.600
Those are my guns.
How did they
get my guns?

19:23.600 --> 19:26.040
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

19:46.480 --> 19:50.720
He says,
"Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

19:50.800 --> 19:52.640
"in the history of America."

19:56.080 --> 19:57.600
He is honored.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.880
He wants you to
build the missile.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.600
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.320
This one.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.440
I refuse.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.200
PEPPER: Tony!

21:18.200 --> 21:20.520
He wants to know
what you think.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.280
I think you got
a lot of my weapons.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.400
He says they have
everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.120
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.000
He says for you
to start working immediately,

21:45.080 --> 21:48.360
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.040
No, he won't.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.880
No, he won't.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.560
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.760
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

22:15.360 --> 22:19.120
Look, what you just saw,

22:19.920 --> 22:22.000
that is your legacy, Stark.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.000
Your life's work,
in the hands of
those murderers.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.400
Is that how you
want to go out?

22:29.920 --> 22:34.880
Is this the last
act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

22:35.600 --> 22:37.200
Or are you going to
do something about it?

22:37.280 --> 22:42.400
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me,
you, either way.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.760
And if they don't,
I'll probably be
dead in a week.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.160
Well, then,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.880
this is a very
important week for you,
isn't it?

22:51.600 --> 22:52.560
Hmm?

22:53.680 --> 22:55.120
TONY: If this is going to be
my work station,

22:55.160 --> 22:57.000
I want it well-lit.
I want these up.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.520
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.760
I need a soldering station.
I need helmets.
I'm gonna need goggles.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.240
I would like
a smelting cup.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.800
I need two sets
of precision tools.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.560
How many languages
do you speak?

23:20.640 --> 23:21.680
A lot.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.480
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.600
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

23:26.680 --> 23:30.080
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.440
Who are these people?

23:32.520 --> 23:35.520
They are your
loyal customers, sir.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.240
They call
themselves the Ten Rings.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.120
You know,
we might be more productive

23:49.200 --> 23:52.000
if you include me
in the planning process.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.120
Uh-huh.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.800
Okay, we don't need this.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.240
What is that?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.080
That's palladium,
0.15 grams.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.120
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go
break down the other 11?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.160
WHAT'S HE DOING?

24:20.920 --> 24:22.200
WORKING.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.640
Careful. Careful,
we only get one shot at this.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.440
Relax. I have steady hands.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.920
Why do you think
you're still alive? Huh?

24:46.200 --> 24:48.160
What do I call you?

24:48.240 --> 24:49.880
My name is Yinsen.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.440
Yinsen.
Nice to meet you.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.200
Nice to meet you, too.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.520
That doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.080
That's because
it's a miniaturized
arc reactor.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.200
I got a big one
powering my factory
at home.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.280
It should keep
the shrapnel
out of my heart.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.040
But what could
it generate?

25:49.120 --> 25:53.680
If my math is right,
and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.680
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.800
Yeah. Or something
big for 15 minutes.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.080
This is our
ticket out of here.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.800
What is it?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.200
Flatten them out and look.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.840
Oh, wow.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.440
Impressive.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.440
Good.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.200
Good roll.
Good roll.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.880
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.760
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.760
It's actually a nice place.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.600
Got a family?

27:03.640 --> 27:08.000
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.400
And you, Stark?

27:14.520 --> 27:15.560
No.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.160
No?

27:18.520 --> 27:21.080
So you're a man
who has everything

27:21.760 --> 27:23.120
and nothing.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.200
IT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE
PICTURE.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.800
MAYBE IT'S BEEN MODIFIED.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.960
THE TAIL IS WRONG.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.080
IT'S JUST BACKWARDS.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.720
Relax.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.040
The bow and arrow

29:14.120 --> 29:17.000
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.960
It allowed the great
Genghis Khan

29:22.760 --> 29:25.760
to rule from
the Pacific to
the Ukraine.

29:26.360 --> 29:30.080
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

29:31.240 --> 29:34.760
and four times
the size of the
Roman Empire.

29:38.400 --> 29:39.720
But today,

29:40.560 --> 29:44.000
whoever holds
the latest Stark weapons

29:45.040 --> 29:46.920
rules these lands.

29:49.240 --> 29:50.560
And soon,

29:53.600 --> 29:55.280
it will be my turn.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.960
WHY HAVE YOU FAILED ME?

30:11.040 --> 30:12.680
WE'RE WORKING.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.400
DILIGENTLY.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.440
I LET YOU LIVE.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.480
THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

30:21.240 --> 30:23.760
IT'S VERY COMPLEX.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.160
HE'S TRYING VERY HARD.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
ON HIS KNEES.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.080
YOU THINK I'M A FOOL?

30:34.840 --> 30:36.080
I'LL GET THE TRUTH.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.200
WE'RE BOTH WORKING.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.800
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.960
What does he want?

30:48.160 --> 30:50.520
YOU THINK I'M A FOOL?

30:54.360 --> 30:55.840
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:56.360 --> 30:58.840
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.600
HE'S BUILDING YOUR JERICHO.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.880
What do you want?
A delivery date?

31:13.160 --> 31:14.480
I need him.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.160
Good assistant.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.160
Okay? Can you move?

32:34.640 --> 32:36.480
Okay, say it again.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.080
41 steps straight ahead.
Then 16 steps,

32:39.160 --> 32:42.640
that's from the door,
fork right,
33 steps, turn right.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.480
WHERE IS STARK?

32:52.560 --> 32:53.920
HE WAS HERE A MOMENT AGO.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.480
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.360
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

33:13.840 --> 33:15.480
Say something.
Say something back to him.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.960
He's speaking Hungarian.
I don't...
Then speak Hungarian.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.240
Okay. I know.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.480
What do you know?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.920
How'd that work?
Oh, my goodness.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.000
It worked all right.
That's what I do.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.640
Let me finish this.
Initialize the power sequence.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.040
Okay.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.320
Now!
Tell me.
Tell me.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.160
Function 11.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.000
Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.680
It should be up right now.
Yes.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.880
Talk to me.
Tell me when
you see it.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.480
I have it.
Press Control "I".

34:02.600 --> 34:05.000
"I." Got it.
"I." "Enter."
"I" and "Enter."

34:05.080 --> 34:06.840
Come over here
and button me up.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.040
Okay. All right.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.480
Every other hex bolt.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.680
They're coming!
Nothing pretty,
just get it done.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.120
Just get it done.
They're coming.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.840
Make sure the checkpoints
are clear before you
follow me out, okay?

34:20.920 --> 34:22.680
We need more time.

34:23.840 --> 34:24.840
Hey,

34:25.680 --> 34:27.200
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.880
Stick to the plan!

34:29.680 --> 34:31.080
Stick to the plan!

34:33.040 --> 34:34.240
Yinsen!

37:26.920 --> 37:28.160
Yinsen!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.360
Watch out!

37:44.480 --> 37:45.640
Stark.

37:46.920 --> 37:49.040
Come on.
We got to go.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.680
Move for me, come on.
We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.680
This was always
the plan, Stark.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.280
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.720
My family is dead.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.800
I'm going to see
them now, Stark.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.720
It's okay.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.760
I want this.
I want this.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.720
Thank you for saving me.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.160
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.240
My turn.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.840
Not bad.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.120
Hey!

41:46.720 --> 41:48.640
How was the "fun-vee"?

41:50.920 --> 41:53.320
Next time,
you ride with me, okay?

42:24.360 --> 42:26.160
Watch it,
coming up here.

42:28.120 --> 42:31.280
TONY: Are you
kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

42:36.440 --> 42:37.440
Hmm.

42:39.520 --> 42:42.880
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for
your long-lost boss?

42:42.960 --> 42:45.440
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.520
Yeah, vacation's over.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.440
Where to, sir?

42:50.520 --> 42:52.160
Take us to the hospital,
please, Happy.
No.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.320
No? Tony, you have to

42:53.360 --> 42:54.400
go to the hospital.
No is a complete answer.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.240
The doctor has
to look at you.
I don't have to do anything.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.000
I've been in captivity
for three months.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.840
There are two things
I want to do. I want
an American cheeseburger,

43:01.880 --> 43:02.880
and the other...
That's enough of that.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.360
...is not what you think.
I want you to call for
a press conference now.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.720
Call for a press conference?
Yeah.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.320
What on earth for?
Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.560
Look at this!

43:25.400 --> 43:26.600
Tony.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.320
We were going to
meet at the hospital.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.840
No, I'm fine.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.280
Look at you!

43:34.080 --> 43:36.440
You had to have
a burger, yeah?
Well, come on.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.680
You get me
one of those?

43:37.760 --> 43:39.000
There's only one left.
I need it.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.760
Hey, look
who's here! Yeah!

43:50.120 --> 43:51.640
Miss Potts?
Yes.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.960
Can I speak to
you for a moment?

43:53.040 --> 43:55.200
I'm not part of
the press conference,

43:55.280 --> 43:56.680
but it's about to
begin right now.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.080
I'm not a reporter.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.600
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

43:59.640 --> 44:01.440
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

44:01.480 --> 44:03.120
and Logistics Division.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.440
That's quite a mouthful.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.920
I know.
We're working on it.

44:05.960 --> 44:10.440
You know, we've been
approached already by
the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

44:10.520 --> 44:14.200
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.960
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances
of his escape.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.560
I'll put something
in the book, shall I?

44:19.600 --> 44:21.200
Thank you.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.320
Uh...

44:26.120 --> 44:28.720
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

44:28.800 --> 44:32.200
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can
see me, and I can...

44:32.400 --> 44:34.480
A little less formal and...

44:39.320 --> 44:40.880
What's up with the love-in?

44:40.960 --> 44:42.040
Don't look at me.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.200
I don't know
what he's up to.

44:44.280 --> 44:45.400
Good to see you.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.680
Good to see you.

44:46.760 --> 44:49.200
I never got to say
goodbye to Dad.

44:49.440 --> 44:52.160
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.280
There's questions
that I would
have asked him.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.400
I would have asked him
how he felt about
what this company did.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.800
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

45:05.680 --> 45:10.000
Or maybe he was
every inch the man we all
remember from the newsreels.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.480
I saw young
Americans killed

45:17.360 --> 45:21.360
by the very weapons
I created to defend them
and protect them.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.160
And I saw

45:25.360 --> 45:28.960
that I had become part of
a system that is comfortable
with zero accountability.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.240
Mr. Stark!
Hey, Ben.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.240
What happened over there?

45:35.840 --> 45:39.520
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize
that I have more

45:39.560 --> 45:44.000
to offer this world
than just making
things that blow up.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.520
And that is why,
effective immediately,
I am shutting down

45:47.600 --> 45:51.280
the weapons
manufacturing division
of Stark International

45:51.360 --> 45:55.360
until such a time as I can
decide what the future
of the company will be.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.040
I think we're
gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.880
What direction
it should take, one
that I'm comfortable with

45:58.920 --> 46:03.000
and is consistent
with the highest good
for this country, as well.

46:04.360 --> 46:09.160
What we should
take away from this
is that Tony's back!

46:09.560 --> 46:11.880
And he's healthier
than ever.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.400
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

46:15.480 --> 46:17.920
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.360
Where is he?
He's inside.

46:33.240 --> 46:36.080
Well, that...
That went well.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.600
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

46:38.680 --> 46:41.000
Your head?
What about my head?

46:41.080 --> 46:44.080
What do you think the
over-under on the stock drop
is gonna be tomorrow?

46:44.160 --> 46:45.760
TONY: Uh, optimistically,
40 points.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.280
At minimum.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
Yep.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.280
Tony, we're
a weapons manufacturer.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.040
Obie, I just don't
want a body count
to be our only legacy.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.720
That's what we do.
We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.960
It's my name
on the side
of the building.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.640
And what we do
keeps the world from
falling into chaos.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.680
Not based on
what I saw.

47:04.960 --> 47:05.960
We're not doing
a good enough job.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.280
We can do better.
We're gonna do
something else.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.520
Like what?

47:08.640 --> 47:10.000
You want us to
make baby bottles?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.480
I think we should take
another look into
arc reactor technology.

47:14.600 --> 47:18.920
Ah, come on.
The arc reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

47:19.240 --> 47:22.400
Tony, come on.
We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

47:22.480 --> 47:25.600
It works.
Yeah, as a science project.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.560
The arc was
never cost effective.

47:27.640 --> 47:29.360
We knew that
before we built it.

47:29.440 --> 47:32.600
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

47:32.640 --> 47:33.800
Maybe.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.840
Huh? Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that in what?

47:36.960 --> 47:39.480
30 years.
That's what they say.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.320
Could you have
a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

47:44.400 --> 47:47.640
Never mind who told me.
Show me.
It's Rhodey or Pepper.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.040
I want to see it.
Okay, Rhodey.

47:58.480 --> 47:59.960
Okay.
Okay?

48:03.200 --> 48:04.520
It works.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.720
Listen to me, Tony.
We're a team.
Do you understand?

48:12.800 --> 48:16.080
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

48:16.160 --> 48:17.560
like your father and I.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.440
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

48:19.520 --> 48:21.120
But if I had...
Tony.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.200
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.040
You understand me?
That was Dad's line.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.800
You gotta let me
handle this.

48:29.880 --> 48:32.280
We're gonna have to play
a whole different
kind of ball now.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.200
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

48:34.240 --> 48:37.520
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.560
Stark Industries!

48:39.640 --> 48:42.520
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

48:42.560 --> 48:43.720
Sell, sell, sell!

48:43.920 --> 48:45.920
Abandon ship!

48:46.000 --> 48:49.400
Does the Hindenburg
ring any bells?

48:50.720 --> 48:55.680
Let me show you the
new Stark Industries
business plan!

48:57.320 --> 49:00.600
Look,
that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

49:01.760 --> 49:04.600
TONY: Pepper.
How big are your hands?

49:05.120 --> 49:07.360
What?
How big are your hands?

49:07.400 --> 49:10.320
I don't understand why...
Get down here. I need you.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.760
Hey.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.320
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.400
Let's see them.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.840
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.320
I just need your
help for a sec.

49:31.080 --> 49:33.320
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

49:33.400 --> 49:35.920
It was.
It is now an antique.

49:36.760 --> 49:39.560
This is what will
be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.600
I'm swapping it up
for an upgraded unit,

49:41.680 --> 49:43.920
and I just ran into
a little speed bump.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.920
Speed bump,
what does that mean?

49:45.960 --> 49:47.280
It's nothing.
It's just a little snag.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.720
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.960
And it's contacting the
socket wall and causing
a little bit of a short.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.680
It's fine.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.480
What do you want me to do?
Put that on
the table over there.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.360
That is irrelevant.
Oh, my God!

50:00.440 --> 50:04.760
I want you to reach in,
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.640
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.

50:07.680 --> 50:09.360
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

50:09.440 --> 50:10.800
the socket wall
or it goes "beep."

50:10.840 --> 50:11.960
What do you mean,
"Operation"?

50:12.000 --> 50:13.360
It's just a game,
never mind.

50:13.440 --> 50:17.480
Just gently lift the wire.
Okay? Great.
Okay.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.800
You know,
I don't think that I'm
qualified to do this.

50:21.840 --> 50:25.920
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified,

50:26.000 --> 50:29.520
trustworthy person
I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

50:30.800 --> 50:32.800
Is it too much of
a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

50:32.840 --> 50:35.520
Okay, okay.
I really need your help here.

50:35.600 --> 50:36.760
Okay.

50:41.040 --> 50:42.680
Oh, there's pus!

50:42.760 --> 50:47.360
It's not pus.
It's an inorganic plasmic
discharge from the device,

50:47.480 --> 50:49.360
not from my body.
It smells!

50:49.480 --> 50:51.000
Yeah, it does.

50:51.360 --> 50:52.640
The copper wire.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.040
The copper wire,
you got it?

50:54.120 --> 50:55.280
Okay, I got it! I got it!
Okay, you got it?

50:55.360 --> 50:56.360
Now, don't let it

50:56.400 --> 50:58.280
touch the sides when
you're coming out!

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

50:59.400 --> 51:00.760
That's what
I was trying to
tell you before.

51:00.840 --> 51:03.040
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull
it out, you don't...

51:03.040 --> 51:04.960
There's a magnet
at the end of it!
That was it.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.040
You just pulled it out.

51:06.120 --> 51:07.280
Oh, God!
Okay, I was not expecting...

51:07.360 --> 51:09.520
Don't put it back in!
Don't put it back in!
Okay, what do I do?

51:09.560 --> 51:10.600
What's wrong?

51:10.680 --> 51:13.320
Nothing, I'm just going into
cardiac arrest 'cause you
yanked it out like a trout...

51:13.360 --> 51:16.280
What? You said it was safe!
We gotta hurry.
Take this. Take this.

51:16.360 --> 51:18.360
You gotta switch
it out really quick.
Okay. Okay.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.480
Tony? It's going to be okay.
What?

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
Is it?
It's gonna be okay.

51:21.600 --> 51:24.280
I'm gonna make this okay.
Let's hope.

51:24.800 --> 51:28.920
Okay, you're gonna attach
that to the base plate.
Make sure you...

51:33.000 --> 51:35.400
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?

51:35.480 --> 51:37.200
Here, I got it.
I got it. Here.

51:37.720 --> 51:38.760
Nice.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.120
Are you okay?
Yeah, I feel great.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.440
You okay?

51:43.880 --> 51:46.760
Don't ever, ever, ever,

51:46.840 --> 51:49.840
ever ask me to do
anything like that
ever again.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.080
I don't have
anyone but you.

51:57.680 --> 51:58.720
Anyway...

52:04.560 --> 52:06.040
What do you want me
to do with this?

52:06.080 --> 52:07.520
That?

52:08.280 --> 52:09.680
Destroy it.

52:10.200 --> 52:11.720
Incinerate it.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.000
You don't want to keep it?

52:14.080 --> 52:18.240
Pepper, I've been called
many things. "Nostalgic"
is not one of them.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.160
Will that be all,
Mr. Stark?

52:20.280 --> 52:22.040
That will be all,
Miss Potts.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.920
Hey, Butterfingers,
come here.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.920
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

52:27.040 --> 52:30.240
That's my phone,
that's a picture
of me and my dad.

52:30.280 --> 52:33.240
Right there.
In the garbage.
All that stuff.

52:39.400 --> 52:43.680
RHODES:
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

52:43.960 --> 52:46.120
I'll tell you,
in my experience,

52:46.160 --> 52:50.960
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

52:51.280 --> 52:52.600
his insight,

52:52.640 --> 52:55.680
that ability to look
into a situation
beyond the obvious

52:55.760 --> 52:59.400
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.600
Colonel?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.480
Why not a pilot
without the plane?

53:02.560 --> 53:04.600
Look who fell
out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.560
Hello, sir.
Speaking of
manned or unmanned,

53:06.640 --> 53:08.480
you gotta get him
to tell you about the
time he guessed wrong

53:08.560 --> 53:11.200
at spring break.
Just remember that,
spring break, 1987.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.560
That lovely lady
you woke up with.
Don't do that!

53:12.640 --> 53:14.040
What was his name?
Don't do that.

53:14.120 --> 53:15.200
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.480
They'll believe it.
Don't do that.

53:16.560 --> 53:17.760
Okay.
Don't do that.

53:17.840 --> 53:20.840
Pleasure meeting you.
Give us a couple minutes,
you guys.

53:23.720 --> 53:25.400
I'm surprised.
Why?

53:25.480 --> 53:28.200
I swear,
I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.160
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.720
Really?
Yeah.

53:32.400 --> 53:35.040
Rhodey, I'm working on
something big.

53:35.200 --> 53:38.160
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.840
You're about to make
a whole lot of people
around here real happy,

53:41.960 --> 53:44.960
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

53:45.000 --> 53:46.640
that was a doozy.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.520
This is not for the military.
I'm not... It's different.

53:51.600 --> 53:54.280
What? You're
a humanitarian now
or something?

53:54.360 --> 53:55.760
I need you to listen to me.
No.

53:55.840 --> 53:59.760
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.200
I'm serious.
Okay.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.320
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

54:08.360 --> 54:09.600
Thanks.

54:17.840 --> 54:19.560
Jarvis, you up?

54:19.600 --> 54:21.200
For you, sir, always.

54:21.520 --> 54:25.400
I'd like to open
a new project file,
index as Mark II.

54:26.560 --> 54:30.280
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries
Central Database?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.960
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

54:33.080 --> 54:34.600
Till further notice,
why don't we just
keep everything

54:34.680 --> 54:35.920
on my private server?

54:35.920 --> 54:38.680
Working on
a secret project,
are we, sir?

54:42.600 --> 54:45.760
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

54:47.880 --> 54:50.360
Maybe in mine,
it can actually
do some good.

55:33.640 --> 55:36.320
Next. Up.

55:36.960 --> 55:39.880
Not in the boot, Dummy.
Right here. You got me?

55:39.960 --> 55:42.040
Stay put. Nice.

55:43.840 --> 55:47.680
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe.
I got this.

55:48.160 --> 55:50.320
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

55:57.200 --> 55:58.400
Up.

55:59.240 --> 56:01.080
Screw it. Don't even move.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.200
You are a tragedy.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.680
Okay, let's do this right.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.160
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.120
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby
for fire safety.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.640
You, roll it.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.520
Okay. Activate
hand controls.

56:36.840 --> 56:38.000
We're gonna start
off nice and easy.

56:38.080 --> 56:41.280
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity
achieves lift.

56:41.360 --> 56:42.680
And three,

56:43.520 --> 56:44.560
two,

56:45.360 --> 56:46.520
one.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.920
Up two.
All right, set that.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.400
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

57:28.440 --> 57:30.320
Yeah, everything's... What?

57:30.400 --> 57:31.560
Obadiah's upstairs.
Great!

57:31.600 --> 57:33.680
What would you
like me to tell him?
Great. I'll be right up.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.360
Okay.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.960
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.040
It is.

57:39.520 --> 57:43.080
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.400
I didn't expect that.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.120
How'd it go?

57:57.360 --> 57:59.040
It went that bad, huh?

57:59.120 --> 58:01.760
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

58:01.800 --> 58:05.720
doesn't mean it went bad.
Uh-huh. Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.680
It would have gone better
if you were there.
Uh-uh.

58:08.960 --> 58:10.480
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.840
I lay low, and you
take care of all...
Hey, come on.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.120
In public.
The press.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.680
This was a board of
directors meeting.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.800
This was a board of
directors meeting?

58:21.400 --> 58:23.880
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

58:23.960 --> 58:25.080
They're filing an injunction.

58:25.120 --> 58:27.200
A what?
They want to lock you out.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.520
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

58:28.600 --> 58:29.600
We knew that
was gonna happen.

58:29.640 --> 58:31.760
Fifty-six and a half.
It doesn't matter.

58:31.800 --> 58:34.040
We own the
controlling interest
in the company.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.880
Tony, the board
has rights, too.

58:37.760 --> 58:41.640
They're making
the case that you
and your new direction

58:41.680 --> 58:44.000
isn't in the company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible!

58:44.040 --> 58:47.080
That's a new
direction for me,
for the company.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.880
I mean, me on the company's
behalf being responsible
for the way that...

58:51.960 --> 58:53.000
This is great.

58:53.040 --> 58:56.520
Oh, come on.
Tony. Tony.
I'll be in the shop.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.840
Hey, hey!
Hey, Tony. Listen.

58:58.880 --> 59:02.240
I'm trying to turn this
thing around, but you
gotta give me something.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.920
Something to pitch them.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.520
Let me have
the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.720
No. No, absolutely not.
It'll give me
a bone to throw the boys

59:09.800 --> 59:11.400
in New York!
This one stays with me.

59:11.480 --> 59:12.520
That's it, Obie.
Forget it.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.320
All right, well,
this stays with me, then.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.240
Go on, here,
you can have a piece.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.800
Take two.
Thank you.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.760
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

59:19.840 --> 59:21.480
Good night, Obie.

59:22.120 --> 59:26.960
Day 11,
test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

59:27.040 --> 59:29.680
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

59:29.760 --> 59:32.600
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you
to a city college.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.520
All right,
nice and easy.

59:34.600 --> 59:39.520
Seriously,
just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.160
And three, two, one.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.000
Okay.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.920
Please don't
follow me around
with it, either,

59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.440
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.240
Just stand down!
If something happens,
then come in.

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:05.560
And again,
let's bring it up to 2.5.

1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:07.240
Three, two, one.

1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:26.400
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be!

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:27.840
Oh, not the car,
not the car!

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:30.160
Table!

1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:45.400
Could be worse!
Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:05.000
No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh!

1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:08.760
Yeah, I can fly.

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:16.480
Jarvis, are you there?
At your service, sir.

1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:17.640
Engage Heads Up Display.

1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:18.800
Check.

1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.920
Import all preferences
from home interface.

1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.480
Will do, sir.

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:30.440
All right,
what do you say?

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:34.000
I have indeed
been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:35.720
Can we start
the virtual walk-around?

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.840
Importing preferences
and calibrating
virtual environment.

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.200
Do a check on
control surfaces.

1:01:40.280 --> 1:01:41.840
As you wish.

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:06.280
Test complete.
Preparing to power down
and begin diagnostics.

1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:09.280
Uh, yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:10.840
Start listening in
on ground control.

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:12.040
Sir, there are
still terabytes

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:14.680
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:18.680
Jarvis!
Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:23.080
Ready? In three, two, one.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.200
Handles like a dream.

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:17.880
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:19.360
What's SR-71's record?

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.280
The altitude record
for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.360
Records are made
to be broken! Come on!

1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:33.160
Sir, there is
a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:34.320
Keep going!

1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:37.920
Higher!

1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:55.880
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.960
Come on,
we got to break the ice!

1:04:36.200 --> 1:04:37.520
Kill power.

1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:05.080
Notes. Main transducer
feels sluggish at
plus 40 altitude.

1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:07.040
Hull pressurization
is problematic.

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:09.600
I'm thinking icing
is the probable factor.

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:11.920
JARVIS: A very astute
observation, sir.

1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:13.760
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:15.320
we should improve
the exosystems.

1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:17.960
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure
the shell metals.

1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:21.160
Use the gold titanium alloy
from the seraphim
tactical satellite.

1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:23.040
That should ensure
a fuselage integrity

1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:25.120
while maintaining
power-to-weight ratio.

1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:26.440
Got it?
Yes.

1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.880
Shall I render using
proposed specifications?

1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:30.280
Thrill me.

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.840
REPORTER ON TV:
Tonight's red-hot red carpet

1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:36.240
is right here at
the Disney Concert Hall,

1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:38.640
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit

1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:40.600
for the Firefighter's
Family Fund

1:06:40.640 --> 1:06:42.240
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

1:06:42.280 --> 1:06:43.600
Jarvis, we get an
invite for that?

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:46.160
JARVIS: I have no record
of an invitation, sir.

1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:47.720
WOMAN ON TV:
...hasn't been seen
in public

1:06:47.800 --> 1:06:51.520
since his bizarre
and highly controversial
press conference.

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.400
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

1:06:54.480 --> 1:06:58.080
and has been
bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.320
no one expects
an appearance
from him tonight.

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:03.560
JARVIS:
The render is complete.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:05.320
A little ostentatious,
don't you think?

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:08.480
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:12.720
Tell you what.
Throw a little
hot-rod red in there.

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:15.680
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:20.800
The render is complete.

1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:23.160
Hey, I like it.
Fabricate it. Paint it.

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:24.840
Commencing
automated assembly.

1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:28.080
Estimated completion
time is five hours.

1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:29.360
Don't wait up for me, honey.

1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:57.240
Weapons manufacturing
is only one small part of
what Stark Industries

1:07:57.320 --> 1:07:59.080
is all about,
and our partnership

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:01.000
with the fire and
rescue community...

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:05.400
Hey, Tony,
remember me?

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:06.720
Sure don't.

1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:09.240
You look great, Hef.

1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:12.440
We're going to
have a great quarter.

1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:16.240
What's the world coming to
when a guy's got to
crash his own party?

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:20.560
Look at you.
Hey, what a surprise.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:22.400
I'll see you inside.

1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:26.240
Hey. Listen,
take it slow,
all right?

1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:28.080
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:31.720
You got it.
Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.120
Give me a Scotch.
I'm starving.

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.240
Mr. Stark?

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.240
Yeah?
Agent Coulson.

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:44.960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:48.360
Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement
and Logistics Division.

1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:50.080
God, you need
a new name for that.

1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:52.120
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.760
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.

1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.800
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,

1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:00.760
and time can be a factor
with these things.

1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:02.880
Let's just put
something on the books.

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.320
How about
the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:09.920
Tell you what. You got it.
You're absolutely right.

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.400
Well, I'm going to
go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:17.960
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.280
What are you doing here?
Just avoiding
government agents.

1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:22.160
Are you by yourself?
Yes. Where'd you
get that dress?

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.080
Oh, it was
a birthday present.
That's great.

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:26.280
From you, actually.
Well, I got great taste.

1:09:26.360 --> 1:09:27.640
Yes.

1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.640
You want to dance?
Oh, no.

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:32.200
All right, come on.
Thank you. No.

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.840
Am I making you
uncomfortable?

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:50.520
No. No. I always forget
to wear deodorant and
dance with my boss

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.440
in front of
everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:55.840
You look great
and you smell great.

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:57.280
Oh, God.

1:09:57.320 --> 1:09:59.240
But I could fire
you if that would
take the edge off.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:03.000
I actually don't think
that you could tie
your shoes without me.

1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:04.480
I'd make it a week. Sure.
Really?

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:07.080
What's your
Social Security number?

1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:12.320
Five.
Five?

1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:14.480
Right.
Right.

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.880
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:20.160
The other eight?
So I got you for
the other eight.

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:34.960
How about a little air?
Yes, I need some air.

1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:39.680
That was totally weird.
Totally harmless.

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.560
It was totally
not harmless,
by the way.

1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.080
We're dancing.
No one's even watching.

1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:45.960
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:49.200
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they just...
People... We just danced.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.680
No, it was not just a dance.
You don't understand
because you're you.

1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:55.560
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:58.880
and how you are with girls
and all of that,
which is completely fine.

1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:01.360
But, you know,
then me, you're my boss,

1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:03.400
and I'm dancing with you.
I don't think it
was taken that way.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:06.360
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:08.360
I just think
you're overstating it.
You know, and we're here,

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.240
and then I'm wearing
this ridiculous

1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:15.080
dress, and then we were
dancing like that and...

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.920
I would like a drink, please.
Got it, okay.

1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:36.200
I would like
a vodka martini, please.
Okay.

1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:40.960
Very dry with olives,
a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:44.920
Two vodka martinis,
extra dry, extra olives,
extra fast.

1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:47.120
Make one of them dirty,
will you?

1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.400
Wow. Tony Stark.

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:57.080
Oh, hey.
Fancy seeing you here.

1:12:01.120 --> 1:12:02.120
Carrie.
Christine.

1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:03.200
That's right.

1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:05.960
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:07.440
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.960
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:11.400
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:12.840
involvement in
this latest atrocity.

1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.160
Yeah. They just put my name
on the invitation.

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:15.440
I don't know
what to tell you.

1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:17.920
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:20.400
I was out of town
for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:22.800
Is this what you
call accountability?

1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.600
It's a town
called Gulmira.
Heard of it?

1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:38.320
When were these taken?

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:39.560
Yesterday.

1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:42.080
I didn't approve
any shipment.
Well, your company did.

1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:44.120
Well, I'm not my company.

1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:46.440
Please, do you mind?

1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:48.480
Have you seen
these pictures? Huh?

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:49.920
What's going on in Gulmira?
Tony, Tony.

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.480
You can't afford
to be this naive.

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:53.320
You know what?
I was naive before,

1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:55.040
when they said,
"Here's the line.
We don't cross it.

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:56.720
"This is how
we do business."

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:00.000
If we're double-dealing
under the table... Are we?

1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:02.560
MAN: Tony,
your picture, please!

1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:08.320
Let's take a picture.
Come on. Picture time!

1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.200
Tony. Who do you think
locked you out?

1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:17.200
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:22.360
It was the only way
I could protect you.

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.040
No. No.

1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:38.320
The 15-mile hike to
the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described

1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:42.080
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day
Heart of Darkness.

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:45.200
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:47.000
have been driven
from their homes,

1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:49.160
displaced from their lands
by warlords

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:51.320
emboldened by
a new-found power.

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:54.680
Villagers have been forced
to take shelter in
whatever crude dwellings

1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:57.560
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:01.480
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet
smelting plant.

1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:09.640
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group of
foreign fighters

1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:12.440
referred to by locals
as the Ten Rings.

1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:16.080
As you can see,
these men are heavily armed
and on a mission.

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.240
A mission that could
prove fatal to anyone
who stands in their way.

1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.040
With no political will
or international pressure,

1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.600
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:28.920
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband,

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.800
who was kidnapped
by insurgents,

1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:33.440
either forced to
join their militia...

1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:37.120
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:39.760
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:43.440
A child's simple question,
"Where are
my mother and father?"

1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.480
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:51.440
refugees who can
only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:26.480
HURRY IT UP.

1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:27.640
PUT THE WOMEN IN THE TRUCKS.

1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:28.760
STACK THE WEAPONS HERE.

1:16:28.840 --> 1:16:29.880
CLEAR ALL THE HOUSES.

1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:30.680
THAT ONE THERE.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:31.480
FASTER. FASTER.

1:16:39.320 --> 1:16:40.360
GRAB THAT DOG.

1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:45.280
PUT HIM WITH THE OTHERS.

1:16:56.240 --> 1:16:57.600
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:11.000
SHOOT THIS DOG.

1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:12.880
YOU'RE ALL INCOMPETENT.

1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:17.120
TURN YOUR HEAD!

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:25.400
He's all yours.

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:25.840
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared
to go in there?

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:26.960
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
CALIFORNIA

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.400
No, they were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.

1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:30.600
Put me through to State.
They're going to
be all over this.

1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:31.920
MAN 1: Get those monitors up!

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.360
We got a bogey!

1:19:33.400 --> 1:19:35.560
MAN 2: Wasn't Air Force!
We got the CIA on the line?

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:37.600
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:39.360
No, it definitely
is not us, sir!

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:41.120
It wasn't Navy.
Wasn't Marines.

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:43.680
I need answers!
Can I please get
eyes on target?

1:19:43.760 --> 1:19:46.040
MAN 3: Negative, negative.
MAN 4: Cannot identify.

1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:48.760
Get me Colonel Rhodes
from Weapons Development
down here now!

1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:57.320
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:59.120
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:01.440
Any high altitude
surveillance
in the region?

1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:03.200
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk
in the area.

1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:04.960
So this thing just
appeared out of nowhere?

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:06.440
How come it didn't
show up on the radar?

1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:08.480
Got a minimal radar
cross-section, sir.

1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:10.720
Is it stealth?
No, sir, it's tiny.

1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:13.200
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:15.120
Colonel, what are
we dealing with here?

1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:20.600
Let me make a call.
Sergeant, clear a hole.

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:25.960
Hello?
Tony?

1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:27.800
Who's this?
It's Rhodes.

1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:30.120
Sorry, hello?
I said it's Rhodes.

1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:33.080
Speak up, please.
What in the hell
is that noise?

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.800
Oh, yeah, I'm driving
with the top down.

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.640
Yeah, well,
I need your help right now.

1:20:36.680 --> 1:20:38.080
It's funny how
that works, huh?

1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:41.560
Yeah. Speaking of funny,
we've got a weapons depot
that was just blown up

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.280
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

1:20:43.360 --> 1:20:45.000
Well, that's a hot spot.

1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:47.600
Sounds like someone
stepped in and did
your job for you, huh?

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:48.760
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:50.040
I'm not, I was just
jogging in the canyon.

1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:51.920
I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving

1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:53.800
to the canyon,
where I'm going to jog.

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:56.240
You sure you don't have
any tech in that area
I should know about?

1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:57.800
Nope!
MAN: Bogey spotted!

1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.160
MAJOR ALLEN:
Whiplash, come in hot.

1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:00.640
Okay, good,
'cause I'm staring at one

1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:04.120
right now,
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come.

1:21:04.680 --> 1:21:06.440
That's my exit.

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:14.320
Ballroom, this is
Whiplash One. I've got
the bogey in my sights.

1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:16.360
Whiplash One,
what is it?

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:17.800
I've got no idea.

1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:18.880
MAJOR ALLEN:
You have radio contact?

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:20.200
Non responsive, sir.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.360
Then you are
clear to engage.

1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:24.400
TONY: Hit it.

1:21:29.200 --> 1:21:32.240
That bogey just
went supersonic.
I got a lock!

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:38.240
JARVIS: Inbound missile.
TONY: Flares!

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:43.840
Wait a second.
Bogey deployed flares!

1:21:58.160 --> 1:21:59.360
Deploy flaps!

1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:01.840
Holy!

1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:03.480
That thing just
jumped off the radar, sir.

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:05.120
The sat visual
has been lost.

1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:06.880
No way that's a UAV.

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.120
What is it?

1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:09.760
I can't see anything.

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:12.320
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.

1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:15.400
I think bogey's
been handled, sir.

1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:26.480
Hello?
TONY: Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:28.240
It's who?
I'm sorry, it is me.

1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:29.600
You asked.
What you were
asking about is me.

1:22:29.680 --> 1:22:31.200
No, see,
this isn't a game.

1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:34.560
You do not send
civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.560
You understand that?
This is not
a piece of equipment.

1:22:36.680 --> 1:22:39.440
I'm in it.
It's a suit.
It's me!

1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:41.960
Rhodey, you got
anything for me?

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:44.760
MAJOR ALLEN:
Mark your position
and return to base.

1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:46.480
Roger that, Ballroom.

1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:49.920
On your belly!

1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:51.880
It looks like a man!

1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:54.760
Shake him off!
Roll! Roll!

1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:03.920
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:06.320
MAN 4: It's confirmed.
He has been hit.

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:12.440
WHIPLASH TWO:
Punch out! Punch out!

1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:20.640
Whiplash One down.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.280
Whiplash Two,
do you see a chute?

1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:24.640
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1:23:30.120 --> 1:23:31.520
My chute's jammed!

1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:39.880
Sir, I've got
a visual on the bogey.

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:42.600
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot,
you take it.

1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:47.000
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1:23:47.040 --> 1:23:49.160
Call off the Raptors.
That thing just
took out an F-22

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:50.560
inside a legal no fly zone!

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:53.000
Whiplash Two, if you have
a clear shot, take it!

1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:55.440
JARVIS: You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:56.880
Keep going!

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.520
WHIPLASH ONE:
Good chute! Good chute!

1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:15.840
Tony, you still there?

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:17.000
Hey, thanks.

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:19.680
Oh, my God,
you crazy son of a bitch.

1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:21.880
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:26.160
Yeah, well,
technically, he hit me.

1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:27.800
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:30.760
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.480
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:35.080
TONY: Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:36.880
RHODES: It's not that simple.

1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:39.520
An unfortunate
training exercise

1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:42.480
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:46.640
I am pleased to report
that the pilot
was not injured.

1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:50.640
As for the unexpected
turn of events on the
ground in Gulmira,

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:54.200
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:58.440
but I can assure you that
the United States government
was not involved.

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:01.560
TONY: Hey!

1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:05.360
JARVIS:
It is a tight fit, sir.

1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:09.240
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this
is going to hurt.

1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.240
Be gentle.
This is my first time.

1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:13.560
I designed this to
come off, so...

1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:15.000
Hey.

1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:18.520
I really should be
able to...

1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:20.280
JARVIS: Please,
try not to move, sir.

1:25:21.520 --> 1:25:23.840
What's going on here?

1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:32.440
Let's face it.
This is not the worst thing
you've caught me doing.

1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.880
Are those bullet holes?

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:03.600
Welcome.

1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:09.040
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:13.640
If you'd killed him
when you were supposed to,
you'd still have a face.

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:15.800
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.

1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:17.640
Show me the weapon.

1:26:18.880 --> 1:26:22.360
Come. Leave your
guards outside.

1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:41.680
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:46.320
So this is
how he did it.

1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:49.160
This is only a first,
crude effort.

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:51.680
Stark has
perfected his design.

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:54.600
He has made
a masterpiece of death.

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.440
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.360
And you dream of
Stark's throne.

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:06.400
We have a common enemy.

1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:12.680
If we are still
in business,

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:17.400
I will give you
these designs

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:19.920
as a gift.

1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:23.000
And in turn,

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:29.760
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:45.800
THIS IS THE ONLY GIFT
YOU SHALL RECEIVE.

1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:48.080
Technology.

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:53.480
It's always been
your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.840
Don't worry.
It'll only last
for 15 minutes.

1:27:59.080 --> 1:28:01.480
That's the least
of your problems.

1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:09.360
Crate up the armor
and the rest of it.

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.040
All right,
let's finish up here.

1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:19.920
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:21.720
and I'm going to
want this data masked.

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:23.560
Recruit our top engineers.

1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:25.520
I want a prototype
right away.

1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:36.840
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send
you on an errand?

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:39.160
I need you to
go to my office.

1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:42.120
You're going to hack
into the mainframe and
you're going to retrieve all

1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:44.800
the recent
shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:46.440
This'll get you in.

1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:48.120
It's probably
under Executive Files.

1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:50.640
If not,
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:53.360
to look for the lowest
numeric heading.

1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.120
And what do you plan to
do with this information
if I bring it back here?

1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.280
Same drill.

1:28:57.320 --> 1:28:59.360
They've been
dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:02.560
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1:29:03.480 --> 1:29:04.560
Tony,

1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:08.760
you know that
I would help you
with anything,

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:12.800
but I cannot help you
if you're going to start
all of this again.

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:16.480
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:20.000
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:24.160
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:26.720
Is that so?

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.400
Well, then, I quit.

1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:35.120
You stood by my side
all these years

1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:38.000
while I reaped
the benefits
of destruction.

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:40.160
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:42.080
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.680
You're going to
kill yourself, Tony.

1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:46.640
I'm not going
to be a part of it.

1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:48.680
I shouldn't be alive,

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:52.160
unless it was
for a reason.

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:54.840
I'm not crazy,
Pepper.

1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:58.520
I just finally know
what I have to do.

1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:05.640
And I know in my heart
that it's right.

1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:23.800
You're all I have,
too, you know.

1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:38.160
Sector 16?
What are you
up to, Obadiah?

1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:55.440
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.

1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:57.040
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane...
Oh, my God.

1:31:57.120 --> 1:31:59.840
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:02.640
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:11.040
So, what are we
going to do about this?

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:14.720
Hmm?

1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:26.320
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:37.720
Tony. He always
gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:03.760
I was so happy
when he came home.

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:06.640
It was like
we got him back
from the dead.

1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:11.640
Now I realize,

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:17.200
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:21.640
He left a part of
himself in that cave.

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:26.000
Breaks my heart.

1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:32.280
Well, he's
a complicated person.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.400
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:47.440
You are a very rare woman.

1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:52.120
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.

1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:56.880
Thank you. Thanks.

1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:00.920
I'd better get
back there.

1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:08.440
Is that today's paper?

1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:11.120
Yes.

1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:13.280
Do you mind?

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:15.720
Not at all.
Puzzle.

1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:17.120
Of course.

1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:21.960
Take care.

1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:47.840
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.

1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:48.960
Did you forget
about our appointment?

1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:50.600
Nope, right now.
Come with me.

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:51.800
Right now?
We're going to
have it right now.

1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:53.640
Yeah, walk with me.
Okay.

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.040
I'm going to
give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:01.400
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.320
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have
to call you back.

1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:08.200
Mr. Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:10.560
what you've asked us,
and it seems as though
there's a little hiccup.

1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:12.320
Actually...
A hiccup?

1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:16.200
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology
actually doesn't exist.

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:19.600
So it's...
Wait, wait, wait.
The technology?

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:22.600
William, here is
the technology.

1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:25.680
I've asked you to
simply make it smaller.

1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:29.720
Okay, sir, and that's what
we're trying to do, but
honestly, it's impossible.

1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:36.400
Tony Stark was able to
build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:41.680
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.

1:35:57.800 --> 1:35:59.880
PEPPER: Tony?

1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:04.840
Tony, are you there?
Hello?

1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:07.640
Breathe.

1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:11.560
Easy, easy.

1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.920
You remember
this one, right?

1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:19.960
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.160
There's so many
applications for causing
short-term paralysis.

1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:27.400
Ah, Tony.

1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:34.400
When I ordered
the hit on you,

1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:39.560
I worried that I was

1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:44.600
killing the golden goose.

1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:49.680
But, you see, it was just

1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:53.320
fate that you survived that.

1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:02.280
You had one last
golden egg to give.

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:11.760
Do you really think
that just because you have
an idea, it belongs to you?

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:20.800
Your father,
he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:25.120
Now, what kind of world
would it be today if he
was as selfish as you?

1:37:35.120 --> 1:37:36.760
Oh, it's beautiful.

1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:44.200
Oh, Tony,
this is your
Ninth Symphony.

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.520
Ah. What a masterpiece.
Look at that.

1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:52.120
This is your legacy.

1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:59.840
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:06.800
Weapons that will
help steer the world
back on course,

1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:09.120
put the balance of
power in our hands.

1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:12.360
The right hands.

1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:20.040
I wish you could
see my prototype.

1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:22.880
It's not as...

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:27.240
Well, not as
conservative as yours.

1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:32.120
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:35.160
I would have preferred
that she lived.

1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:50.480
What do you mean,
he paid to have
Tony killed?

1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:53.200
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1:38:54.400 --> 1:38:55.720
Okay, where's Tony now?

1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:57.520
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1:38:57.560 --> 1:38:59.720
Please go over there
and make sure
everything's okay.

1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:02.400
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.

1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:10.040
Good boy.

1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:50.960
Tony?

1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:54.680
Tony?

1:40:56.480 --> 1:40:57.600
Tony?

1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:00.840
Tony?

1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:04.600
Tony!

1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:09.080
Tony! You okay?

1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:11.160
Where's Pepper?

1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:13.080
She's fine.
She's with five agents.

1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:15.480
They're about to
arrest Obadiah.

1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.680
That's not
going to be enough.

1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:47.560
Section 16.
Section 16.
There it is.

1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:59.240
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:01.480
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:03.000
It's, like, a thing
that's going to
pick the lock?

1:42:03.080 --> 1:42:05.800
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:26.920
That's the coolest
thing I've ever seen.

1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.760
Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.840
You need me to
do anything else?

1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:41.240
Keep the skies clear.

1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:47.640
Damn!

1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:57.360
Next time, baby.

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.840
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:33.440
I thought it'd be bigger.

1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:19.400
AGENT: Take him out!

1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:32.200
How do you think the
Mark I chest piece
is going to hold up?

1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:34.560
JARVIS: The suit's at 48%
power and falling, sir.

1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:37.360
That chest piece
was never designed
for sustained flight.

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:38.960
Keep me posted.

1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:41.760
TONY: Pepper!

1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:43.280
Tony! Tony,
are you okay?

1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:44.840
I'm fine.
How are...

1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:46.840
Obadiah, he's gone insane!
I know.

1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.720
Listen, you'd
better get out of there.
He built a suit.

1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:50.240
Get out of there right now!

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:04.440
Where do you think
you're going?

1:45:09.920 --> 1:45:12.920
Your services are
no longer required.

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:14.600
TONY: Stane!

1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:41.480
I love this suit!

1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:42.640
Put them down!

1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:44.680
Collateral damage, Tony.

1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.400
Divert power
to chest RT.

1:45:57.120 --> 1:45:59.240
JARVIS: Power reduced to 19%.

1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:08.160
Lady!

1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:12.120
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:46:34.200 --> 1:46:37.160
For 30 years,
I've been holding you up!

1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:44.040
I built this company
from nothing!

1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:48.880
Nothing is going
to stand in my way.

1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:57.520
Least of all you!

1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:10.400
Impressive!
You've upgraded
your armor!

1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:13.680
I've made some
upgrades of my own!

1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:24.000
JARVIS: Sir, it appears
that his suit can fly.

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:25.720
Duly noted. Take me
to maximum altitude.

1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:28.120
JARVIS: With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1:47:28.200 --> 1:47:30.360
TONY: I know the math! Do it!

1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.960
Sir, you're not
going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:43.680
Get me Major Allen.
Scramble the jets!

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:49.400
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:50.720
Yes, sir.

1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:00.600
JARVIS: Thirteen percent
power, sir.
Climb!

1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:06.600
Eleven percent.
Keep going!

1:48:13.360 --> 1:48:15.480
Seven percent power.
Just leave it on the screen!

1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:17.160
Stop telling me!

1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:31.480
You had a great idea,
Tony, but my suit is
more advanced in every way!

1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:34.080
How'd you solve
the icing problem?

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:35.640
Icing problem?

1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:40.240
Might want to
look into it.

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:53.200
JARVIS: Two percent.

1:48:55.320 --> 1:48:57.840
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1:48:57.920 --> 1:48:58.920
Whoa!

1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:13.360
Potts!
Tony! Oh, my God,
are you okay?

1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:17.560
I'm almost out of power.
I've got to get out of this
thing. I'll be right there.

1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:19.000
Nice try!

1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:33.440
TONY: Weapons status?

1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:35.760
JARVIS:
Repulsors offline.
Missiles offline.

1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.520
Flares!

1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:52.120
Very clever, Tony.

1:49:57.440 --> 1:49:59.920
Potts?
Tony!

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:01.000
This isn't working.

1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:03.400
We're going to have to
overload the reactor
and blast the roof.

1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:04.880
Well, how are you
going to do that?

1:50:04.920 --> 1:50:06.360
You're going to do it.

1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:08.880
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.400
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:13.080
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:14.520
It's going to fry
everything up here.

1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:19.000
Okay. I'm going in now.

1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:22.320
Make sure you wait
till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:33.640
TONY: This looks important!

1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:57.320
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,

1:50:57.400 --> 1:51:01.520
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:12.280
You finally
outdid yourself, Tony!

1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:16.800
You'd have made
your father proud!

1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:24.280
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!

1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:45.120
PEPPER: Tony!

1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:47.960
How ironic, Tony!

1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:52.120
Trying to rid
the world of weapons,

1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:54.840
you gave it
its best one ever!

1:51:54.880 --> 1:52:00.800
Pepper!
And now I'm going
to kill you with it!

1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:06.160
You ripped out my
targeting system!

1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:07.680
Time to hit the button!

1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:09.680
You told me not to!

1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:11.760
Hold still,
you little prick!

1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:15.080
Just do it!

1:52:15.160 --> 1:52:16.360
You'll die!

1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:21.000
Push it!

1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.320
PEPPER: Tony!

1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:30.880
You've all received
the official statement
of what occurred

1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:33.280
at Stark Industries
last night.

1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:38.120
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic
prototype malfunctioned

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:40.800
and caused damage
to the arc reactor.

1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:43.840
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's
personal security staff...

1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:45.840
"Iron Man."
That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:47.400
I mean, it's not
technically accurate.

1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:49.600
The suit's
a gold-titanium alloy,

1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:52.280
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.000
Here's your alibi.

1:53:54.880 --> 1:53:55.960
Okay.

1:53:56.040 --> 1:53:58.200
You were on your yacht.
Yeah.

1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:00.440
We have port papers
that put you in
Avalon all night,

1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:02.200
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:05.440
See, I was thinking
maybe we should say
it was just Pepper and me

1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:07.320
alone on the island.

1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:09.880
That's what happened.
All right.

1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:12.080
Just read it,
word for word.

1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:16.000
There's nothing
about Stane here.

1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:18.880
That's being handled.
He's on vacation.

1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:22.240
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.

1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:24.800
But what about
the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:27.840
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy,
don't you think?

1:54:27.880 --> 1:54:30.200
This isn't
my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.

1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:31.600
Just stick to
the official statement,

1:54:31.680 --> 1:54:34.280
and soon,
this will all
be behind you.

1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:36.640
You've got 90 seconds.

1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:40.760
Oh, Agent Coulson?

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:46.360
I just wanted to say
thank you very much
for all of your help.

1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:49.360
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:51.200
From the Strategic Homeland...

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:52.880
Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:54.480
Right.

1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:56.960
Let's get this
show on the road.

1:54:57.040 --> 1:54:59.360
You know,
it's actually
not that bad.

1:54:59.400 --> 1:55:01.680
Even I don't think
I'm Iron Man.

1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:03.360
You're not Iron Man.
Am so.

1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:05.920
You're not.
All right,
suit yourself.

1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.000
You know, if I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.

1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:11.520
She'd be a wreck,
'cause she'd always
be worrying

1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:12.640
that I was going to die,

1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:15.080
yet so proud of
the man I'd become.

1:55:15.160 --> 1:55:18.880
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:21.680
crazy about me.

1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:23.440
Tell me you never
think about that night.

1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:25.400
What night?
You know.

1:55:28.320 --> 1:55:34.040
Are you talking about
the night that we danced
and went up on the roof,

1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:41.320
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1:55:41.400 --> 1:55:44.640
and you left me there,
by myself?

1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:48.400
Is that the night
you're talking about?

1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:49.480
Mmm-hmm.

1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:51.680
Thought so.

1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:58.120
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Yes, that will be all,
Miss Potts.

1:55:58.200 --> 1:56:01.760
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:04.880
He will not be
taking any questions.
Thank you.

1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:11.440
Been a while since
I was in front of you.

1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:13.080
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.

1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:19.200
There's been speculation
that I was involved in
the events that occurred

1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:20.560
on the freeway
and the rooftop...

1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:23.440
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark,
but do you honestly
expect us to believe that

1:56:23.480 --> 1:56:27.280
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that
conveniently appeared,

1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:30.440
despite the fact that you...
I know that it's confusing.

1:56:30.520 --> 1:56:34.160
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another thing entirely

1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:37.480
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate
that I'm a superhero.

1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:39.200
I never said
you were a superhero.

1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:40.280
Didn't?
Mmm-mmm.

1:56:40.320 --> 1:56:44.640
Well, good,
because that would be
outlandish and fantastic.

1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:49.880
I'm just not
the hero type.
Clearly.

1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:53.480
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:54.920
all the mistakes I've made,

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:56.600
largely public.

1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:58.360
Just stick to
the cards, man.

1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:00.080
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:03.720
The truth is

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:11.360
I am Iron Man.

2:05:14.640 --> 2:05:15.880
Jarvis!

2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:17.680
Welcome home, sir.

2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:26.640
"I am Iron Man."
You think you're the only
superhero in the world?

2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:30.240
Mr. Stark,
you've become part
of a bigger universe.

2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:32.120
You just don't
know it yet.

2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:34.360
Who the hell are you?

2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:37.320
Nick Fury,
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:39.160
Ah.

2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:42.360
I'm here
to talk to you about
the Avenger Initiative.
